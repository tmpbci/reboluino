REBOLUINO

A dead simple how-to reblet that pop up a GUI to send commands to an Arduino style device.

Launch as rebol reboluino.r

Click open button to open the serial port *first*
Click on the commands button you want
Click on Close button to free the serial port

The serial port must modified according to your configuration.
cu.foo is the port used on OS X. Here mine was cu.usbmodemfd1421 :

system/ports/serial: [cu.usbmodemfd1421]

Two buttons are embedded in the GUI, as example, to send two different commands. 

Command1: "ON"
Command2: "OFF"

The included Arduino sketch Lights on and OFF led 13 first to show it's ready as you open the port,
then wait ON and OFF strings to lights ON and OFF LED 13.

You can of course modify the command name, add others,â€¦ as soon as you modify the arduino sketch accordingly.
